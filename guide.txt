Okay so here's the guide to using this program:

- Try giving paths that only use forward slashes "/" and no leading slashes

example: "C:/Games/SDVX5"

formats:

mp3 - Normal mp3 at 44100 hz and 320kbps, i can't give warranty that quality isn't
      lost here because i don't know how the .asf format works. From what i've
      read about the format is that it supports DRM protection, but in true
      konami fashion it's just disabled, lol.

wav - FFMPEG auto-selects 1411kbps so yeah should be lossless but filesize is not
      the best. After some researching it looks like it's caused by the audio
      having a variable bitrate (VBR). So yeah best option is to just listen to
      the .asf files or convert it to this i guess

asf - Basically the exact same file used ingame but only the extension name changed
      from .s3v to .asf   weird but ok, way better than wasting an entire day
      reverse engineering

ok good luck!
